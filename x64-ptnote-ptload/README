; A case study and implementation of the PT_NOTE->PT_LOAD infector, based on the tmp0ut's 1.01   ;
; article and highly ~~copied from~~ inspired by Linux.Midrashim and with some notes of          ;
; Linux.Kropotkine.                                                                              ;

; It mostly works the same as Midrashim but has some smol differences, such as mapping the       ;
; infected file into memory using mmap() and... that's it. (. á´— .) However it does not detect if ;
; it's on a first run, nor is the payload encoded. May that change during our lifetime~          ;
